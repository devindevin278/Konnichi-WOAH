# 👨🏻‍💻 Website Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your Konnichi-WOAH! website, a Japanese language learning website, using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Laravel framework. It assumes that you have already installed XAMPP, Laravel, and have a basic understanding of Laravel's directory structure and concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) : A local development environment that includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) : A dependency manager for PHP.
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) : Required for frontend asset management.

## Installation Steps

Please follow the steps below to install and run your Konnichi-WOAH! website:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository containing your Konnichi-WOAH! website project to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devindevin278/Konnichi-WOAH.git

2. **Open the Project in VSCode:** Launch VSCode and open the project folder by selecting "Open Folder" from the "File" menu. Navigate to the folder where you cloned or extracted the project.

3. **Install Dependencies:** Open the integrated terminal in VSCode by selecting "View" -> "Terminal" from the menu. In the terminal, navigate to the project's root directory (where the `composer.json` file is located) and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install

4. **Install the Laravel Socialite package:** In the terminal, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer require laravel/socialite

5. **Install Frontend Dependencies:** To install Bootstrap using npm, you can run the following command in your project's root directory:
   ```
   npm install bootstrap
   ```
6. **Install Slug Model:** To generate slugs for your Eloquent models,  run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   composer require cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable
   ```

7. **Set Up Environment Variables:** Copy the `.env.example` file in the project root directory and rename the copy to `.env`. Open the `.env` file and update the configuration options such as database connection details according to your local environment:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env

8. **Generate Application Key:** In the VSCode terminal, run the following command to generate an application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate

9. **Create Symbolic Link for Storage:** To access files stored in the Laravel `storage` directory, you need to create a symbolic link. Run the following command in the VSCode terminal:

   ```bash
    php artisan storage:link

10. **Database Setup:** Start XAMPP and ensure that Apache and MySQL are running. Create a new MySQL database for your Konnichi-WOAH! application. Open the `.env` file and update the database configuration options (`DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`) with your database details.

11. **Run Migrations:** In the VSCode terminal, run the following command to run the database migrations and set up the required tables:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate

12. **Set Up Google OAuth Credentials:** To enable Google login using Socialite, you need to set up OAuth credentials from the Google Developer Console. Follow these steps:
    - Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a new project.
    - Enable the Google+ API for your project.
    - Under the "Credentials" tab, create a new OAuth client ID.
    - Set the authorized redirect URI to `http://localhost:8000/login/google/callback`.
    - Copy the client ID and client secret.
    - Open the `.env` file in your project and add the following lines, replacing `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>` and         `<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>` with your actual values:
      
      ```
      GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
      GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
      GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/login/google/callback
      ```
  
13. **Build Frontend Assets:** In the VSCode terminal, run the following command to build the frontend assets:
    
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
     
14. **Run the migrations and seeders:** Type the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

15. **Compile the assets:** Type the following command to terminal and press Enter:
      ```
      npm run dev
      ```
      
16. **Start the Development Server:** In the VSCode terminal, run the following command to start the Laravel development server:
     ```
     php artisan serve
     ```

17. **Access Your Website:** Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to access your Konnichi-WOAH! website. If everything is set up correctly, you should see your application running.
